1. dict.clear()


The clear() method removes all key-value pairs from the dictionary, making it empty.

2. dict.copy()

The copy() method returns a shallow copy of the dictionary.
That means it creates a new dictionary with the same key-value pairs, but changes to the new dictionary won't affect the original.

3. dict.fromkeys()


The fromkeys() method creates a new dictionary using a sequence of keys and assigns the same value to each key.

4. dict.get()

The get() method returns the value for a specified key if the key exists in the dictionary.
If the key is not found, it returns a default value instead of raising an error.
