The format() method is used to insert values into a string using placeholders {}. It allows dynamic formatting by replacing the placeholders with values provided in the method.

2. f-strings (Formatted String Literals)

f-strings (introduced in Python 3.6) allow inserting variables directly into strings using curly braces {}. They are more readable and efficient than str.format().

3. len()


The len() function returns the number of characters in a string (including spaces and special characters). It is a built-in Python function.

4. str.encode()

The encode() method converts a string into a byte representation using a specified encoding (default is "utf-8"). It is commonly used for handling text in different encodings or preparing data for storage/transmission.
